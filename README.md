## 🧠 Introduction

The goal of this project is to create an interactive tool that predicts the likelihood of three different diseases based on user-provided medical information. Models are trained on publicly available datasets for diabetes, Parkinson’s, and heart disease.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Input Form**: Collects health data from the user such as glucose levels, blood pressure, or voice features.
- **Multi-Disease Prediction**: Uses ML models to predict risks for:
  - Diabetes
  - Parkinson's Disease
  - Heart Disease
- **Real-Time Output**: Predictions are displayed immediately after user input.
- **Easy UI**: Built using Streamlit for a clean and modern web interface.
